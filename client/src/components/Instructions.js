            <h2>ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CANDIDATES AND UNDERTAKING</h2>

            <ol>
                <li> The students are expected to be regular in their class work and should conduct themselves in a
                    disciplined manner. They should abide by such rules of discipline and conduct as stipulated by the
                    Institute from time to time. </li>
                <br></br>
                <li>The conduct of the students should be exemplary, not only within the premises of the College but
                    also outside. This will help maintaining prestige and status of the Institute. </li><br></br>
                <li>Ragging is prohibited. Any student participating in ragging will be summarily expelled from the
                    Institute if found, indulging in this heinous act. The first year students are advised to meet with
                    confidence, the Principal or other teachers if they are subjected to ragging by the seniors. This will
                    help us in tackling the menace which is a cognisable offence as per the TS act of prohibition of
                    ragging. The police can also act on their own if they detect ragging when inside the premises of the
                    College.</li><br></br>
                <li> Students shall not object if their parents or guardians are contacted regarding their indiscipline,

                    examinations or any other matter of concern.</li><br></br>

                    will be made available for visits to local Industries. With regard to outstation tours, they may
                    approach the concerned Head of the Department for necessary preparations and organisation. The
                    out-station or local tours are always accompanied by teachers. </li><br></br>
                <li>. The Office Bearers of the Students Association are nominated on the basis of merit in the Semester

                    demonstrations within the college. Participation in any such activity shall automatically result in
                    dismissal from the college. Any problems they face can be represented to the concerned Heads of the

                    institute in any reason. The original certificates and Transfer Certificate will not be issued to them, in
